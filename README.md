# CAN-BUS-Prototype
This project demonstrates the implementation of a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus communication system using an Arduino, MCP2515 CAN controller, and a 20x4 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The prototype showcases how to send and receive CAN messages, display data on an LCD, and use an LED indicator based on specific conditions.
